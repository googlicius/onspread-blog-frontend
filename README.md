# ONSPREAD BLOG

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, install dependencies and run the development server:

```bash
yarn install

yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Folder structure

- `components` - contains all React components of application.
- `graphql` - graphql client queries, mutations, fragments are defined here.
- `pages` - Next.js's pages.
- `public` - images, css, js,...
- `redux` - Redux's stuff: store, reducers,...
- `styles` - Global scss files.
- `apollo-client.ts` - config and initialize Apollo Client.
- `.env` - Default environtment file, create `.env.local` if you want to override variables in it.
- `codegen.yml` - config file of `graphql-code-generator`.
- `serverless.yml` - configuration [Next.js serverless component](https://github.com/serverless-nextjs/serverless-next.js) for AWS Lambda@Edge.
- `next-env.d.ts` - auto-generated by Next.js when adding typescript, you can define some global types here.

## Development

Generate typescript code from graphql client queries, mutations,... (Note: server running is required):

```bash
yarn gen
```

Code style check:

```bash
yarn lint
# Add --fix to auto fix errors:
yarn lint --fix
```

## Testing

Run:

```bash
yarn test
```

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.


## Deploy on AWS

If you prefer AWS platform, Lamda@Edge is a great way to go, this project is already set up with an AWS Cloudformation template: `.aws/templates/deployment.cfn.yml` which creates a S3 bucket to store artifacts. And a Github Actions workflow for automate deployment: `.github/workflows/cd.yml`.

Check out [Serverless Next.js Component](https://github.com/serverless-nextjs/serverless-next.js) for more details.
